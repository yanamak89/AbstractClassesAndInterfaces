# Project README

## Task 1: Learning Objectives
- Study the basic constructs and concepts covered in the lesson.

## Task 2: AbstractHandler Project
- Create a project using Visual Studio with a Console Application template.
- Create an abstract class named `AbstractHandler`.
- Implement methods `void Open()`, `void Create()`, `void Change()`, and `void Save()` within the `AbstractHandler` class.
- Create derived classes `XMLHandler`, `TXTHandler`, and `DOCHandler` from the base class `AbstractHandler`.
- Write a program that defines a document and provides methods for opening, creating, editing, and saving a document in different formats.

## Task 3: IPlayable and IRecodable Interfaces
- Create 2 interfaces named `IPlayable` and `IRecodable`.
- Define 3 methods `void Play()`, `void Pause()`, and `void Stop()` in each interface.
- Define 3 methods `void Record()`, `void Pause()`, and `void Stop()` in the `IRecodable` interface.
- Create a derived class named `Player` from the base interfaces `IPlayable` and `IRecodable`.
- Write a program that performs playback and recording.

## Task 4: MSDN Search
- Visit the MSDN website.
- Search for descriptions of topics related to each example covered in the lesson in the "Recommended Resources" section below.
- Save the links and provide a brief description for each.

## Task 5: Abstract Document Class
- Create a project using Visual Studio with a Console Application template.
- Refactor the example from the first lesson (document handling) to use a common abstract class for all parts of the document.
